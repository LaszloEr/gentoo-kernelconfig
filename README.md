# gentoo-kernelconfig-W520
My kernel configs for Gentoo on the Lenovo Thinkpad W520


- Docker compatibility
- Virtualization
- Nvidia (nouveau, with Optimus PRIME switching) and/or Intel HD graphics support
- Intel wifi adapters enabled. (I recommend upgrading to the Intel 7260 802.11ac adapter or the AX200, you need a custom BIOS for that. Intel stopped contributing to the Linux support of the stock intel 6300 card and it has performance issues).
